# PRONOM submission: RV565 video

Fields for the PRONOM new-format form at The National Archives
(https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/), with sample files to attach.
Versions 6 and 7 are separate format records with separate signatures, as
PRONOM does for other versioned formats; version 7 was added after the
version 6 submission (PRONOM_Research#202) and can be sent as an update to it.

## Description

RV565 is a video container for microcontrollers driving small displays.
Frames are stored in the display's own pixel format, so a player only
decompresses and transfers them. A little-endian header (magic `RV5`,
version, width, height, frames per second, flags, frame count) is followed
by one record per frame, a 32-bit length and the frame data. There is no
audio.

**Version 6**: a 12-byte header; every frame is a zlib stream that inflates
to exactly width × height × 2 bytes of big-endian RGB565 pixels.

**Version 7**: the header grows to at least 16 bytes with a header size, a
pixel format (RGB565 big- or little-endian, packed RGB444, RGB666, RGB888,
8- or 4-bit grayscale, 1-bit monochrome in rows or in 8-row pages), a codec
(stored or zlib) and a keyframe interval. Each record starts with a frame
type: a keyframe, a delta (XOR with the previous frame) or a repeat. Every
frame at a multiple of the keyframe interval is a keyframe, so seeking needs
no scan.

## Internal signatures

Both anchored at the beginning of file (BOF), offset 0.

### Version 6

    52563506{4}[01:1E]{7}78

| Bytes | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `52 56 35` | ASCII `RV5` |
| `06` | container version 6 |
| `{4}` | width and height (u16 each) |
| `[01:1E]` | frames per second, 1–30 |
| `{7}` | flags (1), frame count (2), first frame length (4) |
| `78` | zlib header of the first frame (CMF byte, deflate with 32 KiB window) |

### Version 7

    52563507{4}[01:3C]{3}10[00:08][00:01][01:FF]{4}00

| Bytes | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `52 56 35` | ASCII `RV5` |
| `07` | container version 7 |
| `{4}` | width and height (u16 each) |
| `[01:3C]` | frames per second, 1–60 |
| `{3}` | flags (1), frame count (2) |
| `10` | header size 16, as written by every version 7 writer |
| `[00:08]` | pixel format |
| `[00:01]` | codec: stored or zlib |
| `[01:FF]` | keyframe interval |
| `{4}` | first record length |
| `00` | first frame type: keyframe |

The header size may be larger in later minor revisions; the signature
requires 16 so that the first frame type is at a fixed offset.

Flags are not part of either signature because readers must ignore unknown
bits.
